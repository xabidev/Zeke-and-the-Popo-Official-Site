              If everything can move
              <br />My mind is splintered into piece of sheets
              <br />I finally learned to swept you of my feet
              <br />Into the caldera
              <br />If everything is stopped
              <br />A sweet predicament rise to the top
              <br />Unfolding paradox subconsciously
              <br />Before the caldera

              The allusion of tonight's play is a breakdown of a pedant and his robust gorilla
              <br />He is pandering on a quasi-literate paper
              <br />Now he's flaming out just like the myriad stars

              Smoke a cigarette till everybody's dead, one point one trillions of regrets
              <br />Paint this town in red

              Carry his case, leaving his place
              <br />Fearing his face can't buy the love that has lost with no trace
              <br />Flowery days bloom with disgrace
              <br />Beauty ain't nothing but a waste
              <br />She mounts the steps, down underground
              <br />Waltz till she's drowned
              <br />Dancing in sad sea without any beat
              <br />Pretentious wit, her frozen feet testing the lack of her senses
              <br />Rejects her childhood romances, air is all sucked up by God
              <br />Now is the world unrescued?
            </p>

            <p>
              Planting the seeds
              <br />Secrets to keep
              <br />Story to tell
              <br />Cursing the birthday of life and himself
              <br />Refused to lose the love that I choose
              <br />There ain't no guilt war in my bed
              <br />Whispered to you when you were blue
              <br />Simple but true
              <br />Music's still sorrow, the risk continues
              <br />Hearing the blues
              <br />Promising muse
              <br />Ridding the evening that's drifting
              <br />Burning in the swarm of sunbeam
              <br />Waking one life after life
              <br />Now is the world unrescued?

              You sick and twisted
              <br />You hide all your love behind the cupboard
              <br />Thats where you rot
              <br />Your fear is bubbling
              <br />Your ego's spiraling
              <br />Who shoot the starfish that breath and kiss?
              <br />(Aaah) look at all the stars, the moon that shine on you. Aren't they good enough for you?
              <br />(Aaah) if we cried and laughed would it fill your lonely heart? Put salvation to the start?
              <br />Would you kill when the starfish evacuate?
              <br />We detached people.
              <br />Believe in symbols.
              <br />You read the (twitter), I read (those lies).
              <br />I think I'm tired with all your progress.
              <br />We shoot (the AI), begins to stop.
              <br />A big, big stop.
